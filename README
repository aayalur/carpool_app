Carpool App
===========

Carpool App was a personal startup project.  Unlike most other carpooling solutions, this one tackles "carpooling for everyday life."  The whole idea is this:

John and Jane live and work in the same neighbourhood and have similar schedules. Shouldn't they be carpooling?

Instead of a glorified classified ads system, I sought to match carpoolers based on daily routines.

Although Carpool App is some of the best design work I've done, I subsequently abandoned the idea for various reasons.
